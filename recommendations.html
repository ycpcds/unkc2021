        <h3>STAKEHOLDERS AND CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT</h3>
        <p>
          We propose that curriculum content is decided through an ongoing democratic process, representing the views of 
          both education professionals and pupils. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This could look something like the following:
        </p>
        <p>
          Teachers registered with the GTCS can opt-in to voting on candidates to join a representative panel. Half of these 
          candidates are teachers, and half of these candidates are educationalist academics. There must be explicit and consistent 
          encouragement and support (perhaps including financial support) for candidates from a diverse range of socio-economic 
          and cultural backgrounds to be represented. Panel members will represent each constituent region of Scotland. The proportion 
          of panel members teaching at independent schools cannot exceed the proportion of the Scottish school population enrolled 
          at independent schools. The proportion of panel members teaching at special schools, or specialising in a related academic 
          area, must be at least equal to the proportion of pupils in special schools, units, and/or who require additional support 
          for learning in Scotland. This professional panel would convene each year to propose and vote on amendments to the 
          knowledge-based content of the curriculum, to be implemented in the next academic year. Yearly amendments to the 
          curriculum would require teachers to engage in relevant annual Continued Professional Development (CPD). This will ensure 
          that the knowledge content of the curriculum remains flexible to changes in the development and instrumentalisation of 
          digital technologies. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Each year, the pupils at every Scottish school will be supported by teachers to produce a report on the digital literacy knowledge 
          produced (or co-produced) through learner-centred pedagogy.  These pupil reports may include reflections on digital literacy project 
          work, on critical engagement with issues related to digital literacy or on technological developments, on interschool and international 
          knowledge building work through pupil-led <a href="online-learning-spaces.html">online learning spaces</a>, or, on how technology 
          has been used to support learning and inclusion. Online Learning Spaces (OLS) could be central to this process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, all pupils in Scottish schools can opt-in to voting for candidates to join a representative panel. There will be at least 
          one panel-member representing each year group, from P1-S6, and panel members will represent each constituent region of Scotland. The 
          proportion of panel members attending independent schools cannot exceed the proportion of the Scottish school population enrolled at 
          independent schools. The proportion of panel members attending special schools, units, and/or who require additional support for learning 
          must be at least equal to the percentage of that demographic in the Scottish school population. Facilitators will be elected by the 
          professional panel to support the pupil panel in aggregate data from the annual pupil reports, and synthesise this information to produce 
          a report on the findings of the learner-centred portion of the curriculum. These reports will be used by the professional council to 
          inform their decisions about amendments to the knowledge-based portion of the curriculum.

            <h3>KNOWLEDGE-BASED AND LEARNER-CENTERED</h3>
            <p>
              We propose that the ideal curriculum for 2035 would include knowledge-based criteria to provide equitable access to the same valuable knowledge 
              for all learners, as far as possible. This knowledge would be considered valuable not due to its’ worth according to technological rationality, 
              but due to a) its’ worth in providing access to living a good life and b) its’ worth in developing the criticality necessary for liberatory activism. 
              This would include specific technological skills, such as coding. It would also include critical analysis of how digital technology is instrumentalised 
              and, in turn, instrumentalises us. This knowledge content would also include both historical and contemporary analysis of the development of technologies, 
              their political effects and functions, and moment of resistance – where digital technologies have been used successfully for liberatory ends – focusing 
              on global, local, and national perspectives. At an early level, this might be as simple as identifying advertisements, and engaging in knowledge-building 
              discussions about the functions and effects of advertisements. At an advanced level, this might be as complex as using historiographical debate to 
              synthesise an informed position on the political implications of the use of data mining by Cambridge Analytica.   
            </p>
            <p>
              As discussed above, we also propose that a learner-centered pedagogical approach be used, in part, to inform ongoing amendments to knowledge content of 
              the curriculum. This would be achieved through pupil-led online learning spaces. <a href="online-learning-spaces.html">See Here</a> for further discussion.

            <h3>DISCIPLINARY AND INTERDISCIPLINARY</h3>
            <p>
              We propose that both disciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches be included in the ideal curriculum for 2035. We acknowledge the epistemic value of 
              historically-produced subject-specific knowledge, while at the same time valuing the possibility of new and alternative knowledge production through 
              interdisciplinary learning. The knowledge-content prescribed in our curriculum would feature both epistemological systems. For example, option subjects 
              such as Computing Science, Digital Media, Technology History, or Digital Politics and Philosophy would adhere to specific disciplinary and interdisciplinary 
              knowledge content. Additionally, the development of specified Digital Critical Literacy knowledge outcomes, for all pupils as far as possible, would be the 
              responsibility of all practitioners on an interdisciplinary basis. 
            </p>

        <div class="row widget">
          <div class="col-xs-12">
            <h3>DECOLONISATION OF THE CURRICULUM</h3>
            <p>
              We propose that decolonisation theory should inform all areas of the curriculum. We disagree with the view that digital technology has less to do with politics 
              than other areas of the curriculum. 
            </p>
            <p>
              A commitment to decolonisation of the curriculum would involve specific knowledge content; for example, the use of global perspectives and intersectional analysis 
              of oppressive systems (including class, race, and imperialism among other factors) in regards to historical and contemporary analysis of the political function 
              of digital technologies. 
            </p>
            <p>
              It would require that a diversity of perspectives is proactively sought in design of the curriculum and its annual amendments. It would also require that pupils have 
              an opportunity to co-produce alternative forms of knowledge and power through OLS – or elsewhere – and that this knowledge is incorporated into the curriculum 
              through the annual review. 
            </p>
            <p>
              It might involve a professional commitment to an ethical framework that includes the <em>aims</em> of decolonisation, through the GTCS’s SPR. Specific practices for decolonisation 
              would not be mandated, to allow for some plurality of professional perspectives and approaches.
            </p>
            <p>
              Further, our curriculum would mandate a critical pedagogical approach that restructures the power dynamic between teacher and learner, therefore allowing for democratic 
              dialogue and the production and co-production of non-hegemonic knowledge (and, therefore, non-hegemonic power). Teachers would need to be supported through 
              Initial Teacher Education (ITE) and Continued Professional Development (CPD) to develop an informed position and critical engagement with the politics of education and pedagogy.

          <h3>ASSESSMENT</h3>
          <p>
            We propose that all assessments be formative. Forms of assessment traditionally associated with summative assessment (e.g. tests) will be used formatively to progress learning or to identify 
            teaching and learning needs. Summative assessment may be used as evidence for professional investigations into the relative efficacy of specific approaches to teaching – efficacy in progressing 
            learning, or in intervening in the social reproduction of inequality (e.g. lowering the poverty-based attainment gap, or other measures of wealth inequality). Teachers will share their summative 
            data and findings from these investigations at a local and national level. This will require that teachers are given significant support through ITE and CPD to implement a holistic Assessment 
            if for Learning (AfL) approach supported by a deep understanding of the politics of assessment and of a psychodynamic understanding of the relationship between attachment, feedback, and learning. 
            It will also require a professional commitment to the use of AfL approaches to intervene in the social reproduction of inequality through the GTCS’s SPR.
