        <p>
          <b>UNICEF:</b> Two thirds of the world’s school-age children – or 1.3 billion children aged 3 to 17 years old – do not have internet connection in their homes, according to 
          a new joint report from UNICEF and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). 
          “That so many children and young people have no internet at home is more than a 
          digital gap –it is a digital canyon,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “Lack of connectivity doesn’t just limit children and young people’s ability to 
          connect online. It prevents them from competing in the modern economy. It isolates them from the world. And in the event of school closures, such as those currently 
          experienced by millions due to COVID-19, it causes them to lose out on education. Put bluntly: Lack of internet access is costing the next generation their futures.”

        <b>How</b> people use the internet is more and more relevant as the number of people without internet access reduces. The level of skills to maximise 
        its use has come more into the fore, and digital exclusion has become more about skills than having internet access.

        <p>Some points:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Poorly understood, as technology and society are intrinsically interlinked. Social exclusion is also multifaceted.
          </li>
          <li>
            Helspet and Galacz have reviewed a number of different views regarding this interaction.
          </li>
          <li>
            Digital participation can help to mitigate social exclusion- it can introduce disadvantaged groups to benefits of the internet. 
            But as long as there are inequalities offline (e.g. in education) there will be those who have less access to the internet and digital skills so inequalities will persist online.

        <h3>In Scotland</h3>
        <p>
          Ipsos MORI Scotland research from 2013: digital exclusion in Glasgow had one of the lowest internet uptake in the UK, with 40% of households offline, most prevalent among the lowest socio-economic group.

        <h2>The 'Life World' of Children</h2>
        <p>
          Critical Pedagogy and Inclusion: The Pedagogy underpinning our curriculum includes that of Freire whereby teachers support students to, in Giroux's words: ‘...read both the word and the world’ critically ‘...in order to form practical strategies for inclusion and justice’ 
        </p>
        <p>
          A 1999 study by Max van Marren argues that we need to have congnisance of the ‘life world’ of children, including the socio-political contexts that influence their opportunities and experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          The account of 5th Grade pupils from Cabrini Green, Chicago, one of the most infamous and recognizable housing projects in the U.S.   The programme, Project Citizen set up projects for young people to understand 
          public policy. By tackling an identified problem, students would learn how to effect change in their schools and communities.
        </p>
        <p> Schultz argues that this is an example of students finding relevance: ‘experientially demonstrating their understanding of the data they collected from tangible, real-world experiences that they initiated and care about deeply.’ 
          If YP are more engaged in the curriculum and it is relevant to their lives, attainment, and potentially the attainment gap, will improve. Digital technology will be one of the most significant parts of young people's lives in 15 years.
          A curriculum for the 2030s needs to be informed by pupils’ interests. The most universally esteemed interests in Young People's lives today are media related.

        <h3>Internet Skills and Attainment</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            According to Van Dijk and Van Deursen (2011), the development of digital skills is affected by social environments and patterns of learning through family, friends, schooling and workplace.
          </li>
          <li>
            A study from 2014 by Van Deursen et al, looking at patterns of learning digital skills in the Netherlands showed that: Of internet users who were completely self-reliant a large majority 
            were males and those with higher educational attainment, women and those with lower to medium attainment were more prevalent in the groups who needed support with digital skills. 
          </li>
          <li>
            In 2006, a study by Jackson et al. (2006) showed that children from socially deprived backgrounds who use the internet were shown to have higher scores in standardised tests. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The Technology-Enhanced Learning Research Programme, in 2012, stated: to ‘prosper in the 21st Century, people need to be confident digital collaborators and communicators’.

            "EVC’s methodology of media education unites a student-centred
            approach to learning with community social action. Working on
            documentaries young people are supported to ‘find their own voice’
            (EVC staff member), learning to understand and challenge mainstream media representations of youth through collaborative production and 
            to ‘express themselves and explore issues that are deeply relevant to 
            their lives’ (EVC Curriculum Guide, 2005, Introduction)."  <br><h4>(White,  2018)</h4>

            Community based and learner centred approach to media education doesn’t fit into school structures as well as English etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            Shultz (2007) argues that disadvantaged children often enter school with language and literacy skills way below those of more advantaged peers - the gap only widens and these young people drop out of school early because school doesn’t feel relevant to their lives.

        <h3>Media Studies: Why Does the Subject Get Such Bad Press?</h3>
        <img src="imgs/media-studies-bbc.png"/>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This article questions why some schools in England are phasing out Media and Film studies and there has been a decline in number of pupils taking it from 70000 in 2008 to 50000 in 2014
          </li>
          <li>
            Why when more jobs in this area and more usage, especially social media?
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1930s English was seen as a ‘dangerously newfangled’ subject 
          </li>
          <li>
            Talk of it being a soft option, pupils enjoy it too much.
          </li>
          <li>
            High achieving students often don’t consider it an option as many universities don’t rate it as highly as A level English.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Democratising: The curriculum should relate more to the needs of 'working class' students. It leads to too early specialisation of pupils when they shouldn’t be thinking about future work in subject choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Andrew Crisell, emeritus professor at Sunderland University who taught on one of the first communications degrees, points out that the initiative for media courses came from polytechnics and later the new 
          university sector. “The polys had to position themselves as distinct from traditional unis and one way of doing this was to find gaps in the market and also degrees that might provide routes into the world 
          of work.” He believes the key to media studies’ image problem lies in the association with leisure: “Traditionally media have been associated with recreation, and there is a general assumption that 
          watching films or television involves less intellectual effort than reading a book" <br> (Rustin, 2016)
