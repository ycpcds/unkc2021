      </p>
      <p>
        In order to realise our vision, partners at both a national and local level must work 
        together to achieve all four of the following essential and interrelated objectives 
        that are central to successful digital learning, teaching and assessment:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Develop the skills and confidence of educators in the appropriate and effective use of digital technology to support learning and teaching 
        </li>
        <li>
          Improve access to digital technology for all learners
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensure that digital technology is a central consideration in all areas of curriculum and assessment delivery
        </li>

        <!-- DL fit into CfE -->
        <h3>How does digital literacy fit into the CfE?</h3>
        <p>
          With the onset and spread of Covid19 in 2020 schools closed and the Government began trying to ensure that no child lost out on their 
          education due to closures. Indeed, the difficulties faced by thousands of children with regards to access to digital devices prompted 
          action to ensure digital resources were not only accessible but, perhaps more importantly, beneficial to education. Having to using 
          online methods highlighted the importance of DL for our children. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed, in an ever-growing digital world, as more and more jobs and even everyday skills (e.g., banking) become digitally focused it is our 
          responsibility to ensure that no child is left behind (Education Scotland, 2012) and that every child is afforded the same opportunities to 
          succeed in life. Of course, there are a plethora of factors that implicate this success (REF), and whilst we cannot mitigate many of these 
          (e.g., low socio-economic status), we can strive to make education a consistent and fair construct that provides all children with the same 
          skills to better their life chances. There are organisations trying to ensure all children, and indeed households, in Scotland have access to 
          digital devices and WiFi (E.g. Connecting Scotland). However, this access does not ensure the devices are being used appropriately. Therefore, 
          we argue that embedding DL in the curriculum stands to ensure that learning is the key focus on DL. This learning will be two-fold: 1) Providing 
          children with the opportunities to actively learn about digital resources, online safety etc. and 2) to ensure that children are given the opportunity 
          to become familiar with the digital resources (e.g. through using them to aid learning in other subjects). This, would provide all children with the 
          skills to take forward into working life then we are developing responsible citizens. Currently learner’s in Scotland are suppose to meet the values 
          set from Education Scotland – <b>successful learners</b> which may create <b>confident individuals</b> who can become <b>responsible citizens</b> which 
          can mould <b>effective contributors</b> (Education Scotland, 2021)
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A partnership between government and all 32 local authorities is imperative if all four objectives are achieved and developed within digital learning, 
            achieved and teaching. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Digital learning is already embedded within the curriculum and although not explicitly stated as a mandatory teaching method or learning, however DL 
            is alluded to and there are ways that educators should strive to achieve DL. The strategy is therefore broken down into 4 objectives and implemented 
            using CfE, Provisional Standard set by the GTC and Initial Teacher Education. 
            <ol>
              <li>
                Strategically focusing on improving the current standard of teaching and creating environment in which both learners and parents can take advantage 
                of the opportunity that digital literacy offers

            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Through setting a series of actions to be implemented in school this, in theory, should provide all children, regardless of home environment or other 
            factors that could limit access to digital learning, with the opportunity to experience this and increase their Digital learning, either through supervised 
            learning or learning through play.

            greater emphasis on literacy and numeracy across the curriculum, health and wellbeing, Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and higher order 
            skills, including creativity.</em> 
          </li>
        </ul>
        <!-- /DL fit into CfE -->
        <!-- Pros Cons -->
        <h3>What are the pros and cons of this? </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Local authorities are provided budgets for schools to use to purchase the tools required to allow digital learning to occur. This varies in every LA. 
            Therefore, not all LA have enough budget to have a consistent digital product in every school across Scotland, such as laptops in every school (Digital Connecting Scotland Report, 2021) (App A).
          </li><br>
          <li>
            Unfortunately, during Covid 19 pandemic it was alarming to find many children did not have the accessibility during/outside of school. However, the Government acted and provided all Scottish 
            schools with a budget to either provide children with; laptops, iPads/notebooks which would allow children access to the digital learning platform – SeeSaw (App A)Even though the issue of 
            devices may have been tackled there is still the issue that not all children may have access to WiFi at home and so making this part of the CfE, on par with numeracy and literacy, would 
            allow all children to develop skills with digital resources. (Digital Connecting Scotland Report, 2021) (App B).
          </li><br>
          <li>
            Definition of the term, <em>digital literacy</em> is varied (Buckingham & Willett, 2006; Gee, 2003; Sefton-Green, J, 2009). This in itself may have pros/cons. For example, the broad definition 
            means that teacher can utilise this in a way that they see fit & and through a flexible CfE can be practiced in a variety of ways from educators. However, this may be counterproductive in 
            that there is too much scope and not all children end up receiving the same level of access to resources to help build their DL.
          </li><br> 
        </ul>
        <!-- /Pros Cons -->
        <!-- Major Debates -->
        <h3>What is the major scholarly debate around policy and curriculum? </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The definition of how Digital learning is perceived, many academics argue (Buckingham & Willett, 2006; Gee, 2003; Sefton-Green, J, 2009), it can be argued by Sefton-Green, J, et al that the term 
            ‘digital literacy’ incorporates more exclusion than inclusion due to many equitable issues which prevent the accessibility amongst learners. 
          </li><br>
          <li>
            -	Also, how this term is used to educate individuals within school time, the term literate suggests a competence of an individual but most digital learning goes on outside of school time. This can 
            be evidenced when a criss-cross scenario occurs when learning about digital platform such as social media (Luke, 2003; Sefton-Green, 2004). This becomes a difficult circumstance when the relationship 
            between educators and digital learning vs learners and digital learning differ, who is currently benefiting with the lack of digital knowledge shared in schools vs digital learning explored and 
            shared outside of school (Sefton-Green, J, et al, 2009).

            <h3>Looking at the history of curriculum in Scotland, how likely is it that the CfE will be replaced in 15 years?</h3>
            <p>
              Very likely. There are several factors that affect the current CfE (political, socialism, environmental, funding specific to schools, education improvements specifically for educators). Currently there 
              are concerns round the confidence of the educators themselves due to a lack of engagement with the digital technologies, as well as the concern around the human resources of every child. Simply supplying 
              digital technologies to learners does not simply solve the digital achievement (Sefton-Green, J, et al, 2009). It is a working plan between educators and learners which also enhances this learning 
              (Sefton-Green, J, et al, 2009).

            <p>
              That this is not a simple ‘fixed’. Whilst researching this area of the CfE within Scotland, it was alarming to find that over half of Scottish learners did not have any digital technologies or accessibility 
              to them (Digital Connecting Scotland Report, 2021).

            <p>
              According to Connect Scotland most recent report, stakeholders include Government, economical businesses, intermediary organisations and places similar to Connect Scotland who help provide digital 
              technologies and support with these platforms to low-income families across Scotland (Digital Connecting Scotland Report, 2021)
            </p>
            <p>
              It should be something that the teachers themselves are asked about, as policy seems to overlook the front-line staffing of how the curriculum is used on a daily basis. Importantly, several reviews 
              have occurred during the Scottish National Party reign but none of these reviews have involved teacher voices – which is not something that this curriculum would overlook. In contrast it would heavily 
              involve a nationwide survey on how to make a curriculum that is child centred but with a clear and refined way of teaching which covers all equitable areas and homogeneous way for educators to teach.

      <h3>Should digital literacy be subject specific and/or the responsibility of all practitioners? </h3>
      <p>
        It is our belief that Digital learning should be taught in alignment with other subjects, almost enhancing the wide range of literacies, numeracies, and other subjects. It would support the 8 subjects in 
        more ways than traditionally known and nourish the digital world we find ourselves evolving within.
