        <h3>Global Perception Data and the Business of Competition</h3>
        <p>
          A vast spectrum of organisations are dedicated to measuring, analysing and comparing global perception data sets at continent, country, city 
          level and beyond. This information can help determine current and impending ‘economic, political and cultural success in a nation’ which can be 
          instrumental in decision-making, allowing national citizens, business leaders, organisations and governments to evaluate the ‘health’ of their countries 
          to a more effective degree but it also demonstrates how competitive this business is!
        </p>
        <p>
          These ‘facts and figures’ may remain out of the public eye, for political reasons (for example). On the other hand, some politically-independent 
          organisations may make this ‘perception data’ more explicitly accessible to the wider world. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, ranking of such nature should always be critically acknowledged. In 2013, the BBC News claimed that ‘Global rankings can be misleading 
          and give an inconsistent view of how well an education system is performing, according to a study’. They offered that one example of such an 
          inconsistency could be where nations took part in one international survey, but not in another’, they informed that a great deal of ‘emphasis 
          can be placed on small differences between countries' test scores’.
        </p>
        <h3>Perception Data of Education and Technological Advancement</h3>
        <p>
          For our purpose of considering how digital literacy can be used in a nation’s education, perhaps we could first, with a critical pinch of salt 
          of course, consider what the global rankings say about <b>the best education systems</b> - to establish who these reports claim are leading the 
          world in this respect. This will offer us, certainly one perspective of what the global picture of education leaders looks like. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, we could also consider this data to see which countries are apparently demonstrating the <b>most technological advancement</b>.  Once again, 
          this could be a useful place to begin an examination of what education might look like in these countries. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The ranking data chosen for the intention of reviewing education systems is taken from the 2021 World Digital Competitiveness (WDC) report. 
          Data for technological advancement is taken from the International Institute for Management Development, IMD, annual report. 
        </p>
        <h3>The World Population Review</h3>
        <p>
          The World Population Review is a US-based, independent organisation, that aims to make ‘data more accessible through graphs, charts, analysis 
          and visualizations’. Their goal is to ‘present the most recent information available, and develop projections based on recent growth’. 
        </p>
        <p>
          What you will find is an annual collation and display of trends gathered from a number of projects and not-for-profit organisations, to report 
          the grand context of a nation’s worth, comparable figures and statistics in formats such as league tables, charts and graphs. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The gathering and processing of such data is useful particularly where global comparison is sought – having the data to hand, can offer much 
          insight into the relative ‘performance’ of a country, within the context of its own progress, as well as in the bigger global picture. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The World Population Review’s 2021 report, offers many categories of statistics which can be accessed depending on what you need to know any why. 
        </p>
        <p>
          With respect to education, they state that “while education levels vary from country to country, there is a clear correlation between the quality 
          of a country's educational system and its general economic status and overall well-being”.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is an interesting notion, and one that has been observed time and time again where ‘a higher quality of education is offered to citizens by 
          developing nations than the least developed nations, and fully developed nations’. And in turn, the ‘best quality of education’ is offered to 
          citizens by ‘the most-developed nations’. 
        </p>
        <p>
          So what do the league tables tells us about the countries in the top-five? These are most likely to be countries with the best/most stable 
          economic positions in the global market. And it seems their standard of education is closely related to that. 
        </p>

          <h3>What these rankings tell us about Global Education and Technological Advancement. </h3>
             <p>With respect to the best education systems, the West (US and Europe) appear to be ruling the roost.</p>
             <p>In the rankings for the most-education countries, a different set of countries is revealed in the top five, with the US now falling to the 5th position.</p>
             <p>With respect to technological advancement again the results are mix of Eastern and Western countries as Hong-Kong and Singapore can be seen in the top-five.</p>
             <p>We can accept, however, that such data demonstrates the global competitiveness at play with all nations striving for global recognition in every way possible. </p>

            <p>
              Seventy-eight countries were surveyed and then ranked based upon the results. For the education criteria of the survey, three attributes 
              were equally weighted which include, ‘a well-developed public education system’, applicants ‘would consider attending university there’, 
              and that the country boasts ‘a top-quality education’.

              They produce a number of annual reports measuring trends and global competitiveness with respect to various aspects of 
              business and innovation including a World Digital Competitiveness (WDC) report which ranks countries in order of 
              ‘digital readiness of 64 economies to adopt and explore digital technologies as a key driver for economic transformation 
              in business, government and wider society’. They based their research on three key factors:

        <h3>Economy-driven Education</h3>
        <p>
          Lee and Fredriksen explained that ‘the global landscape is driven by interrelated forces of a knowledge-based 
          and innovation-driven economy, globalization, and rapid advances in science and technology. These trends are 
          accelerating the pace of competition among countries across the world’.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ozturk states that ‘during the twentieth century, education, skills, and the acquisition of knowledge have 
          become crucial determinants of a person’s and a nation’s productivity’. He explains that as countries, for 
          example in the Middle East, began to recognise that being able to compete in the global market sector, they 
          will need to recognise the quality of ‘human capital’ they have to offer against competition. As a result, 
          an overhaul of the quality of the country’s education would be required, so that their citizens would be 
          educated beyond the minimal level and be better equipped for global competition. He goes on to state that. 
          ‘No country has achieved constant economic development without considerable investment in human capital’. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Lee and Fredriksen also highlight Singapore’s education transformation over a number of decades driven by 
          the need to boost its economy. With competition in this landscape increasing, Singapore has invested in 
          Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as a ‘key enabler’ for accelerating its place in the global 
          economic playing field. As a result, it has seen improvements in its economic success due to their investment 
          in ‘ICT manpower development, increased ICT awareness, and literacy of the populace and businesses’. 
        </p>
        <h3>Implications for Digital Technology in Education</h3>
        <p>
          Academics, Neil Selwyn and Jesper Aagaard, wrote a blog for BERA (British Educational Research Association) 
          give a succinct explanation of what our priorities for education should in fact be. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In a blog post titled, ‘Rethinking the ‘digital’ curriculum: What else should we be aiming for?’, they talk 
          specifically about the development of suspicious awareness within us towards big technological firms such as 
          Google and Facebook and that we are now readily addressing ‘the unintended consequences of technology use’.
        </p>
        <p>
          They highlight that education also comes into focus here as strong economies require more digitally-empowered citizens.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          ‘What do young people need to know if they are going to be genuinely digitally empowered? We need to start talking 
          seriously about the undiscussed but crucial “big issues” if school curricula are to have lasting impacts on the 
          digital societies of the 2020s.’
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          They explain that new ‘critical curriculum areas’ need to address the need for students to be supported in making 
          sense of where they fit into the concept of ‘surveillance capitalism’ and understand how their data is collected 
          and sold on (data economy). Students need to be empowered to make ‘informed choices over what they do with digital 
          technology’. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Other areas to help them make informed choices about the products they decide to consume, ethical and moral awareness, 
          impact of digital technology in climate crisis discourses and much more. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Selwyn and Aagaard call this ‘big picture’ thinking and emphasize that these notions need to be factored into 
          new critical forms of digital education and curricula as a matter of urgency.

        <h3>The Other (Neglected) Purposes of Education</h3>
        <p>
          CaixaBank economist, Claudia Canals, warns that we need to be cautious about the reading too much into measurements 
          to avoid ‘inverse causality’. She asks ‘is it the case that countries which invest the most in education grow the 
          most and achieve the highest levels of income? Or, alternatively, do countries with higher levels of income tend 
          to invest more in education?’. She goes on to explain that both scenarios are ‘bound to exist’ but the former 
          possibility has implications for the type of educational policies that will need to be implemented. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Cultivation of democracy and ‘other kinds of externalities’ are other returns that investment in education can 
          offer its nation. The United Nations reminds us that aside from education’s role in democratic and economic growth, 
          ‘education is a fundamental human right and essential for the exercise of all other human rights’. Martha Nussbaum 
          describes these two strands as ‘education for profit-making’ and ‘education for human development’. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In a paper entitled, ‘Education for Profit, Education for Freedom’, Nussbaum explains that in discussions of 
          global justice and citizenship, the two notions are often compared. She goes on to state that humanistic abilities 
          such as ‘critical thinking and imagining’ are neglected in preference of the development of ‘marketable skills’. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In an elaboration of the ‘education is for economic enrichment’ notion, Nussbaum warns that this notion risks 
          the loss of ‘values precious for future democracy’.
        </p>
        <p>
          She explained that it was only required that ‘some people to have more advanced skills in computer science and 
          technology, although equal access is not terribly important: a nation can grow very nicely while the rural poor 
          remain illiterate and without basic computer resources’, driving global inequality.   
          This notion was only concerned with creating ‘a competent tech and business elite’.
        </p>
        <p>
          She says there are profit motives behind such views of the purpose of education and that ‘the student's freedom 
          of mind is dangerous, if what is wanted is a group of technically trained docile technicians to carry out the 
          plans of elites who are aiming at foreign investment and technological development’.
        </p>
        <p>
          In her, perhaps most impactful paragraph, Nussbaum elaborates on the two-fold purpose of ‘education is for human 
          development’ notion:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “First It must promote the human development of students. Second, it must promote in students an understanding 
          of the goals of human development for all- as goals inherent in the very idea of a decent, minimally just society - 
          and it must do that in such a way that when they are empowered to make political choices, they will foster 
          these capabilities for all, not only for themselves’.  
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          She reasons that the benefit of fostering this notion of education would cultivate respect of all and establish 
          an equal weighted entitlement to ‘a range of central human opportunities’ from the outset.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, the American philosopher goes on to propose her 3 key considerations in achieving global citizenship:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Socratic idea that democracy needs citizens to be self-critical and exercise critical thought - essentially 
            thinking for oneself and not giving that entitlement to higher authoritative personnel. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The understanding and acceptance that one is a ‘member of a heterogenous nation- the world’
          </li>
          <li>
            To exercise ‘narrative imagination’ – which describes the ability to consider what it might be like to 
            walk in the other person’s shoes. 
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Education for economical enrichment is purely profit driven and the qualities required for fostering the 
          notion of human development toward a global fair and just world are neglected. 
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          It is important to highlight here that there is no doubt that education is a ‘critical component of a country’s 
          human capital’. Catherine Grant, form the Institute of Developmental Studies, wrote a report in 2017 titled 
          ‘The contribution of education to economic growth’ and explained that education ‘increases the efficiency of 
          each individual worker and helps economies to move up the value chain beyond manual tasks or simple production 
          processes’. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Nussbaum argues that, beyond the profit-driven economic gains however, education’s purpose for human development 
          should also be considered as this is essential for addressing matters of global inequalities to strive towards 
          a more fair and just world. A vision for future education policies and curricula?

      </header>
      <p>
        Korea ranked as the fourth ‘most educated’ country in the World Population Reviews 2021 listings. It boasts a 
        commitment and drive towards global competitiveness that is seen in all its national activities. It may not be 
        the most technologically advanced according to 2021 analyses, nor did it appear in the top ten of the best 
        education systems rankings but in subject performance test analyses (for mathematics, science and reading) 
        they appeared second, just beaten by China. But these rankings are the comparative results of Eastern and 
        Western countries together; if looking at Asia alone, Korea is a force to be reckoned with. 
      </p>

    <div class="row">
      <article class="col-md-4 maincontent">
        <h3>Korean Education: Reforms</h3>
        <p>
          In 1948 the Korean ‘Education Act’ was set in place to establish an education system that was very closely 
          modelled to that of the Chinese education system, the Chinese system are educational leaders in the East! 
          The financial support required by the Koreans to establish such a system was offered from countries 
          like the US, which boosted industrialization into more robust terrain and resulting in ideal consequences 
          for the structure of the Korean education system.  Their education is politically overseen by the Korean 
          Ministry of Education, MOE. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The Korean education system is based upon a traditional philosophical idea of universal ‘welfare of mankind’ 
          or <em>Hongik Ingan</em>. And has undergone a number of significant reforms over previous decades.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the earlier reforms in the 1950s, aimed to achieve a democratic education system. By the 1990s, the 
          focus came to ‘local autonomy’ which was henceforth included on their education policy agendas. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The World Education News & Reviews (WENR), a non-for-profit, news and information source reviewed South 
          Korea’s education system in 2015 and reported that ‘Korea’s high educational attainment levels are but one 
          sign of the country’s singular transformation and meteoric economic rise over the past 70 years’. 
        </p>

      <article class="col-md-4 maincontent">
        <h3>Educational attainment for Power</h3>
        <p>
          They went on to state that, ‘educational attainment in contemporary Korea is of paramount social importance 
          and strongly correlated with social mobility, income levels, and positions of power’ and that competition 
          to get in their universities was extremely tough. 
        </p>
        <p>
          By the year 2007, Korea boasted an impressive number of higher education institution which has recently seen to 
          decline as a result of financial constraints on the institutions or due to the merging of institutions.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Especially designed for higher education system reforms in mind, the government has implemented and invested 
          in projects such ‘The Brain Korea 21 Project’ which offer targeted research and development for the intention 
          to boost competitiveness in the global university sector. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Having assessed the bigger picture of their education system, it is clear to see that Korea demonstrate an 
          ideal example of a nation whose education system is primed for economic enrichment. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Caroline McClatchey, of BBC News, posted an article in 2013 titled, ‘What is the key to a successful 
          education system?’ in which Korea also featured. An expert of East Asian education systems, based at the 
          Institute of Education in London, was able to shed light on what values Korean education was based on mentioning 
          the emphasis on examination results as the key determiner in a child’s status and social mobility.

        <h3>Korea ICT and Digital Literacy</h3>
        <p>
          Jang <em>et al.</em> state that Korea is home to a number of global ICT manufacturing brands, Samsung and Nokia, 
          for example, as well as a number of well-known mobile applications, with world leading market penetration. They 
          also highlight that Korea’s competitive ‘educational philosophies and systems’ are driven by ‘relative rankings’.
        </p>
        <p>
          Edutopia, which is an American website published by the George Lucas Educational Foundation (GLEF), posted an article 
          in 2012, titled, ‘International Comparisons in Digital Literacy: What Can We Learn?’ in which they highlighted the 
          results of an international scholastic assessment of 15-year-old students, conducted by PISA in 2009. The results 
          of this study revealed that in measurements of digital literacy skills and competencies, Korean students ranked first 
          in the digital reading metrics. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Anne O’Brien, the author of this article highlighted that there appeared to be ‘a socioeconomic background is 
          associated with digital reading performance’. She also pointed out that ‘while overall access to information and 
          communications technology (ICT) has grown significantly in recent years, a digital divide (often linked to socioeconomic 
          background) still exists between and within countries’.
        </p>
        <p>
          O’Brien stated that more needed to be done to address this digital divide to reduce the gap between advantaged and 
          disadvantaged pupils at home as well as school. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Addressing the issue of inequalities appears to be a pressing matter in the Korean education, welfare, and democratic systems.

        <h2 class="page-title">Global Examples of Digital Literacy for Human Development and Political Liberation</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        Beyond utilisation of digital education for profit-driven purposes, another realm of digital education is needing our focus. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In a paper titled, ‘Towards a Radical Digital Citizenship in Digital Education’, Professors Emejulu and McGregor, of the 
        University of Edinburgh, discuss a ‘need for politically informed understandings of the digital, technology and citizenship 
        and for a ‘radical digital citizenship’ in which critical social relations with technology are made visible and emancipatory 
        technological practices for social justice are developed’. 
      </p>
      <p>
        They highlight that ‘digital citizenship’ would ‘displace instrumental conceptions of digital literacy, which reduce digital 
        citizenship to mere skills acquisition for navigating a digital world’ and challenge the education and political instructions 
        around seeing a ‘relationally’, against or competitively, and instead trying to recognise links between, global discrepancies 
        seen in social justice, education and other examples of the many crises we face today. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Emejulu and Mcgregor reiterate Freire’s quote. ‘reading the world’ and explain that it should be an underpinning notion in 
        ‘digital citizenship’ and explore the emancipatory possibilities that ‘new’ digital technologies can offer. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Digital education has also been enormously purposefully to highlight or raise awareness of global issues, particularly through 
        the use of social media, for example in social movements or climate justice coverage. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Such examples may not be many but they are complex entities that cannot be fully justified in a limited ‘review’ such as this, 
        therefore I will endeavour to focus on a couple of these so as to offer just a snapshot of the points I am trying to make. 
      </p>

    <h3>Indigenous People and Social Media Activism</h3>
    <div class="row widget">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
          Professor Marisa Duarte’s  2017 paper titled, ‘Connected Activism: Indigenous Uses of Social Media for Shaping Political Change’, 
          cites Earl and Kimport’s 2013 research about the three possible approaches that online social movements can follow; one being the 
          collective action approach which are largely comprised of the on-the-ground actions of protests and petitions etc; the collective 
          action with connective capacity approach harnesses social media to generate support and disseminate information for example; the 
          connective action approach, which utilises social media’s networking facility to not only provide dynamic spaces for ‘collectively 
          imagining alternative social and political visions, naming social phenomena, processing tragedy and trauma, and correlating personal 
          experiences to social and political forces’, but they might be used to exert action towards some politically processes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indigenous peoples’ lack the accessibility to the political participation they desperately seek, results in often having to resort 
          to tactics such as, protesting, lobbying and campaigning. The Social Media Networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook, then 
          provide them a much needed platform for connective activism opportunity because for them every digital, social, political platform 
          they can utilise towards their goals is crucial:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          ‘specific political goals become part of the greater interplay of forces shaping decolonisation efforts’
        </blockquote>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">

    <h3>Black Lives Matter Movement</h3>
    <div class="row widget">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <img src="imgs/bp-miller-KFTob8JDrSY-unsplash.jpg" alt="" width=400px/>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
          The Black Lives Matter activist movement as #BlackLivesMatter was started in on social media in 2012 by three black women activists in 
          response to the shooting of a 17-year-old black youth in Florida and the subsequent acquittal of his shooter. This example of racial 
          inequality served by the US criminal justice system was far from new. Socio-politically, this injustice has garnered consistent prominence 
          over the decades, and now through this movement (and similar others) social media networking sites like Twitter, provide a ‘new public sphere’ 
          for the wider community including activists to come together in solidarity of the issue and use their voices, particularly those groups 
          that have had their voices silenced. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In a paper titled, ‘Social Media Participation in an Activist Movement for Racial Equality’, De Choudhry et al explore what the role of social 
          media has been’ in enabling collective action’ around the Black Lives Matter movement as well as  looking at these how online platforms might 
          enable us to understand how ‘socially-contested issues’ can provide a space for people to, not only express themselves, but offer and insight 
          into how activistic movements can be use social media networking sites as important tools to engage collective action and solidarity. 
        </p>

    </div>
  <h3>Climate Justice</h3>
  <div class="row widget">
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <p>
        Boulianne et al discuss in their 2020 paper titled, ‘“School Strike 4 Climate”: Social Media and the International Youth Protest on Climate Change, 
        in which they discussed the 2019 global climate movement, started by Swedish student Greta Thunberg in 2018, garnered over 1 million young supporters 
        online, in an event to raise awareness of and ‘encourage action on climate change’ and the environmental crisis. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Studies exploring the ‘hashtag’ to identify particular discourses by particular communities about a particular topic found Twitter to be the predominant 
        platform used for information dissemination but was ‘rarely’ used to mobilise for <em>call to action</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2020, Fiona Harvey reported, in an article for The Guardian, that an ‘ innovation brought on by Covid restrictions was a 24-hour Zoom call, featuring 
        people from across the world speaking about the issues in their region, interspersed with activism-related activities for callers’. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Social media has once again, demonstrated its powerful application in global climate matters, bringing together communities for important connection, 
        discussion and action over the issues related to it.

  <h3>Belarusian Protests</h3>

    <div class="col-md-6">
      <p>
        A 2020 article written by Gregory Asmolov for the Open Democracy website, titled ‘The path to the square: the role of digital technologies in Belarus’ 
        protests’, described the way Belarus protesters were able to overcome internet blocks issued by authoritarians, to continue with their protests against 
        Alexander Lukashenko’s regime following August 2020 election results. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The state-imposed internet blocks were overcome by protesters that possessed a ‘high level of IT literacy in Belarus, where industries related to 
        information technology have been actively developing’. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This is one example where the ‘internet did not become a key mechanism for mobilising and coordinating protests, but it did create conditions in which 
        the rapid and mass involvement of citizens became possible’.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also in 2020, Daniel Bush, of Stanford University, wrote an article titled, ‘No Modest Voices: Social Media and the Protests in Belarus’ in which he 
        reported the results of a survey looking at the role of social media platforms on the on-going protests. He reported that ‘Belarusian and Russian-language 
        Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter appear to tilt significantly toward pro-opposition outlets and accounts’.

  <h3>Other Key Examples of where DL has been used effectively in pressing global causes:</h3>
  <div class="row widget">
    <div class="col-md-12">
      <p>
        The Rohingya genocide, Uyghur crisis, G20 Protests and MeToo movement are other examples of where digital literacy has been useful in mobilising 
        and connecting activists in important events and discussions pertaining to the issues respectively. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The scope of all these issues is extremely vast and beyond the boundaries of this article. But the key point to make here is that DL is a powerful 
        tool to utilise for purposes that concern us globally and locally. It has been instrumental in facilitating connection, between people and communities, 
        vocal and silent activists, those with the freedom to express as well those who are supressed. All these examples demonstrate examples of where these 
        tools are used for the global or social greater good as opposed to self-centred pursuits.
