                </header>
                <p>
                    We propose using online learning spaces (OLS) in our literacy curriculum to enable young learners to become digitally competent and improve their literacy skills. 
                    OLS would enable young learners to develop a critical engagement with digital literacy and provide a scope for pupil-led co-production of knowledge. Online learning 
                    spaces would be a platform created to enable students to engage in the literacy curriculum collectively and collaboratively. Students across various Scottish schools 
                    would be partnered together in this initiative and would only use a safe, monitored and child-friendly platform to share learning resources, peer assess and critically 
                    analyse each other’s work. Having an online learning space would allow for the curriculum to go beyond the four walls of the classroom and help our young learners to 
                    collaborate and build meaningful relationships with students from other Scottish schools.
                </p>
                <p><img src="imgs/elenabs_digitalcitizenship.jpg" alt=""/></p>
                <p>
                    We believe that the use of online learning spaces could be extremely beneficial and accessible to students who have difficult home lives and may find it difficult to 
                    engage in their work or do not receive academic support from their family members. In our site-based learning, we have found that our students do their homework at different 
                    times of the day depending on how chaotic their home environments are. Many students have noted that they are only able to do their homework in the morning due to their 
                    parents working long hours in the evening and not having the time to provide their child with academic support. Some parents have noted that their children are being given 
                    too many academic resources to take home such as worksheets, textbooks and story-books which end up being misplaced or lost to which the parents are held liable. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Online learning spaces would be effective in this situation as they can be accessed at any time of the day and our learners could turn to their online learning partners 
                    for help and guidance on any ongoing projects and tasks set by their teachers. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The online learning spaces implemented within our curriculum could also greatly benefit teachers by reducing their workload and enable them to utilise their time more effectively. 
                    Stover, Yearta and Harris (2016) provide a case study of a teacher who used a child-friendly platform to implement the literacy curriculum by moving all of her reading groups online. 
                    The participant of the case study explained how she used recorded videos to manage her book groups which enabled her to dedicate more time in scaffolding for the students who were 
                    struggling or facing extreme difficulties in their studies. We believe it is unfair for our teachers to feel guilty and burdened by their immense workload and we think that online 
                    learning spaces could reduce some of that burden and allow our teachers to spend more time in their classrooms engaging in thoughtful discussions with their students. 
                </p>

                    An article published by National Literacy Trust (2020) has highlighted students’ experiences of reading during the pandemic through the Annual Literacy Survey. The results found that:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    ‘Children’s enjoyment of reading has increased during lockdown (from 47.8% pre-lockdown to 55.9% post-lockdown), having reached a 15-year low before lockdown. More than a 
                    quarter (27.6%) of children and young people say they are enjoying reading more during lockdown. A third (34.5%) of children and young people say they are reading more during lockdown’.
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Interestingly, the report emphasises the possible use of audiobooks to help children’s reading ability as many male students have reported feeling less motivated to read and find it 
                    difficult to engage with books.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, the article states that during the pandemic, young learners had faced major barriers which prohibited them from reading. Due to the closure of schools and libraries, students 
                    felt as though they did not have the adequate resources to read or improve on their literacy skills at home. A lack of support from their peers and teachers also resulted in the students 
                    feeling less motivated to read and felt that their reading abilities had reduced significantly. 
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    “I honestly am finding it very difficult to read since I don’t have reading books. I wish the libraries would open so I could stay on top of my reading and vocab skills since I desperately need to improve.” 
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Interestingly, the report found that students benefited from using technology to engage with literacy at home. 
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    “Sometimes I have to read to my cousin on FaceTime because he suffers from dyslexia.” 
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    “I love reading however I have read most of the books I own already and now I am using reading apps and spend pretty much all day reading.” 
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    “I have got into reading things online such as Webtoons, stories made by others.” 
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    The results from this report only lead us to emphasise the importance of implementing the use of digital technology as a mandatory resource in our curriculum. The barriers that students 
                    have faced during the pandemic could have been overcome by online learning spaces. Videos, audiobooks, online storybooks and various multi-media text could provide a modern way to engage 
                    students with literacy and reading without making them feel limited by the resources they have at home. Moreover, the implementation of online learning spaces could mean that our students 
                    never feel isolated from their peers and educators when they are not physically present in the classroom environment, nor would they feel behind in their studies if they are absent from school.

                        <p>
                            Our ideas of using online learning spaces stem from notions of critical pedagogy and theorists of developmental psychology. When reflecting upon students’ experiences of being 
                            home-schooled during the 2020 pandemic, we realise there were many inequalities our students faced, and we have seen the long-term effects of this in our site-based learning. 
                            Therefore, we are taking on a transformative approach to our curriculum to tackle the injustices our students have faced and to ensure that all students have equal access to online 
                            learning resources regardless of their backgrounds. (Scott, 2006)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Connecting Scotland Programme was initiated in light of the pandemic in 2020 and aims to provide digitally excluded households with digital devices and internet connectivity. 
                            However, not only do we want our students to have access to modern technology, but we want to create online learning spaces so that our curriculum can provide innovative ways for 
                            students to connect and learn from each other on a larger scale. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Piaget (1959) and Vygotsky (1978) have been influential figures in the field of developmental psychology, both theorists highly regard the notion that knowledge amongst children 
                            and young learners should be constructed through social acts. However, whilst Vygotsky believes young learners should best gain knowledge through an expert partner or educator, 
                            Piaget (1959) believes that peer interaction is much more valuable as it allows for criticism and discussion as he believes that adult-child interactions can lead to an imbalance 
                            of power and could cause children to abandon their curiosity and ideas about various phenomena in the world. We believe that learning should go beyond the interaction between the 
                            teacher and student and that it is the teacher’s responsibility to ensure that opportunities are given to students to further peer interaction and peer learning. Therefore, we 
                            believe that online learning spaces could be extremely useful to implement in our curriculum.

                            ‘Shin and Crookes (2005) employed critical pedagogy by creating projects, such as slide presentations, travel plans, discussion groups, poster presentations, and written essays. 
                            The outcomes reported show that students highly valued class discussions as sites for listening to their peers’ thoughts to further their views and experiences. Shin and Crookes 
                            (2005) point out that students engaged in dialogue by asking questions, revealing disagreements, and clarifying others’ comments.’
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although in many westernised schools, it is the norm for students to have meaningful discussions and debates with their teachers, this is not the case in many parts of the world. 
                            Shin and Crookes (2005) conducted their research in a South Korean school where it is uncommon for students to engage in open discussions with their teachers and peers. In this 
                            study, we can see that the researchers adopted theories of critical pedagogy in this South Korean school and the students benefited greatly from this transformative approach.

                            Witte (2007) highlights the potential advantages of online learning spaces but acknowledges that there have been some limitations. The author of this study assigned each student 
                            in their class with a university student whom they would communicate with solely through the use of student blogs. This sparked the interest of the middle school students and 
                            helped them engage in their studies, but the research study faced some complications. The author found that confidentiality and legal issues were brought to light when a student 
                            accidentally released their location online which resulted in the closure of the student blogs. Witte (2007) emphasises the importance of using blogs that are continuously 
                            monitored and anonymous so that the students cannot be identified. Moreover, the study also had some limitations due to the fact that the middle school students were partnered 
                            up with older students with more learning experiences which led to disagreements in online discussions. The younger students felt they were being spoken down to and that their 
                            reflections were being dismissed and overlooked by their learning partners. Overall, Witte (2007) effectively discusses the advantages and disadvantages of student blogs which 
                            have contributed greatly to our understanding of the potential benefits of online learning spaces and how we can overcome the limitations that previous researchers have faced.
